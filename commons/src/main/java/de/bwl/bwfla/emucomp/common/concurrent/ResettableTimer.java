/**
 * A timer that schedules a one-time execution of a given runnable after
 * a specific timeout. As long as the timeout has not expired, this timer
 * can be reset, effectively starting the timeout again.
 * 
 * Note: This implementation creates a lot of new ScheduledFuture instances.
 * Benchmarks (both, on stackoverflow.com and my own) have shown that,
 * once a few instances were created and destroyed, the JVM is *very*
 * fast at creating new instances without much memory overhead. The instance
 * recreation rate for this specific purpose is in tens of thousands per second
 * without a lot of CPU impact and barely any memory overhead.
